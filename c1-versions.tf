# NOTES: Instance type is "t2.medium" because installing artifactory requires at least 4GB.
# Pre-requisites:
# VM needs to have at least 4GB RAM, for AWS choose at least medium instance type.
# Default ports 8081 and 8082 needs to be opened. 8081 for Artifactory REST APIs. 8082 for everything else (UI, and all other productâ€™s APIs).
